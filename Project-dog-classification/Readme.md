# Project dog classification

## Project Overview

In this project convolutional neural network is used to predict the dog breed from a given image. If the image has a human instead of a dog the resembling dog breed is predicted. If the image does not have a dog or a human, the app prints the image has neither human nor a dog. The result is predicted using ResNet50 architrcture.

## Sample Output

The image below displays an potential output if **a dog** is detected on the image.
