# Project dog classification

## Project Overview

In this project convolutional neural network is used to predict the dog breed from a given image. If the image has a human instead of a dog the resembling dog breed is predicted. If the image does not have a dog or a human, the app prints the image has neither human nor a dog. The result is predicted using CNN architectures like ResNet50 and VGG16.

## Sample Output

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification and localization, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!
